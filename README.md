## Getting started with GitHub:
1. Download GIT, and ideally some UI like Github Desktop or GitKraken.
2. Clone the repository. From here on out, work in the folder of this clone.

## Working on the code:
1. Pull the repository.
2. Create a branch (name it something clear; your name and maybe also what you're working on)
3. Change files in the branch as you like

## Saving your work online & keeping it up to date with the main branch:
1. Stash your changes.
2. Pull
3. Apply the stashed changes. (this makes sure your changes are committed to the latest version)
4. Stage and commit changes when you made a relevant update (or just when you want an updated version for version control). Give it a clear name so you can keep track of what changed!
5. Push the committed changes (so it gets uploaded and the others can actually see it!)

## When you have made progress that everyone should continue to use;
Open a pull request, so your branch will be merged with the main branch.

Afterwards, create a new branch to work on new stuff.
