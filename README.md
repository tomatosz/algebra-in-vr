Using Github:

1. Download GIT
2. (Recommended) download Gitkraken or some other program to help you work with GIT (can just use GIT GUI though)
3. Pull the repository
3. Create a branch
5. Change files in the branch as you like
6. Commit the changes
7. Push the committed changes (so it gets uploaded)
8. Open a pull request (so it can be merged)
9. Merge the pull request (idk whether everyone can do that or just me as owner)
